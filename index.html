		<h1> My Favorite Pet </h1>
		<section>
			<a href="index.html">My Pets</a>
			<a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a>
			<p>I have two pets, my dogs Nevaeh and Rosie. I used to have three dogs but our youngest dog Grace had to be put down due to health issues from inbreeding. My dogs were all rescued from the shelter. </p>

			<h2>Nevaeh</h2>
			<p>Nevaeh is our oldest dog, she is a 7 year old labrador mixed with many other breeds, I have no idea what other breeds they would be, but I would expect many breeds due to the weird splotchy coloration in her coat. She is nice for the most part, but she gets very territorial.</p>

			<h2>Nevaeh's favorite things to do</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>She loves to sleep, she is always sleeping if she isn't barking at the mailman</li>
				<li>She loves to eat ice, anytime she hears the refrigerator despensing ice she instantly runs next to you</li>
				<li>She loves to stay outside in the sun, she sleeps in the flowerbed a lot because it is unshaded</li>
				<li>She loves to sleep upside down</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Nevaeh's Life</h2>
			<p>Before we adopted Nevaeh in 2014 she was found in a field and super skinny. She was afraid of everyone when she was a puppy but she's generally warmed up to people now.</p>

			<h2>Nevaeh's Toys</h2>
			<p>Nevaeh has her own favorite toy she won't let anybody else touch, her pink Kong ball. She loves that toy and is always chewing on it, and gets very possessive if Rosie tries to play with it. That was also one of the first toys we got her when we adopted her.
